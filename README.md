# My Personal Website

This website is meant to showcase some of my work and also allow others to check out my qualifications and links. It also serves as a testament to my web development ability.

While this is built in a lot of pure HTML, CSS, and JS I also utilized GreenSock Animation Platform to implement some of the more subtle animations.
